# 🧬 Bhogar: Quantum-AI Powered Drug Discovery

**Bhogar** is a hybrid classical-quantum pipeline for intelligent drug discovery, designed to identify novel therapeutic candidates for complex neurological disorders like Alzheimer's.

> 🔬 Built with PyTorch, Pennylane, SELFIES, and Transformers.  
> ☁️ Deployable via Docker.  
> 🧠 Powered by Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) and Molecular Fingerprints.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Bhogar system integrates **classical deep learning** with **variational quantum models** to perform:

- **Molecular representation learning** from SMILES/SELFIES strings
- **Property prediction** using quantum-enhanced regression/classification
- **Candidate generation** for hit-to-lead optimization
- **Explainability** with attention maps and quantum observables

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.12**
- **PyTorch** for neural model implementation
- **PennyLane** for quantum circuit integration
- **SELFIES** for robust molecular encoding
- **RDKit + DeepChem** (optional) for preprocessing
- **Docker** for containerized deployment
